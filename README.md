# Language Toggle via React Context | Simple Web App

Simple React-based app that lets a user change the language of the content on the page by clicking on the flags of different countries. By leveraging the useContext hook, I'm able to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing props down to each level manually.

I built this simple app in order to practice my understanding of the following topics:

- The Context System
- Getting Data Out of Context
- Creating Context Objects
- Consuming the Context Value
- Context Providers
- "Gotchas" Around Providers
- Accessing Data with Consumers
- Pulling from Multiple Contexts
