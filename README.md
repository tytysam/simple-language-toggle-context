Simple React-based app that lets a user change the language of the page by clicking on the flags of different countries. By leveraging useContext,

I built this simple app in order to practice my understanding of the following topics:

- The Context System
- Getting Data Out of Context
- Creating Context Objects
- Consuming the Context Value
- Context Providers
- "Gotchas" Around Providers
- Accessing Data with Consumers
- Pulling from Multiple Contexts
